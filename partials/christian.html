                Hi guys I'm Christian. I'm 16 years old and I'm pursuing an Electronic Music Production and Sound Desing Degree from Berkleee School of Music.
Let's see a bit about me. I launched a kickstarter project which was funded (awesome!). 
In 2013 I directed, shot and edited a short film titled "The Spy Who Coded" Which will be integrated to SingPath an online game.
I love music and have written three mini-musicals (Mini cuz they were 15 mins long).
I play the piano, drums, guitar, base, harmonica and the accordion. I'm working on my violin as well and hope to also start learning the saxopohone soon! 
It's rather cool too. 
I also enjoy making and editing movies and music in iMovie, and garageband. Ohh I have an album called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0IKh7mAOHAyuBveiPHOjNP">RELICS</a> on Spotify. Do check it out!
